# Dread Mod Loader
A desktop application for loading mods for Metroid Dread. Includes support for [open-dread-rando](https://github.com/randovania/open-dread-rando) JSON files, as well as writing fully custom mods using Python code. Any mod can provide custom assets which will be automatically included in the final exported mod. Mod devs can also provide a custom GUI on a per mod basis for configurable mod settings.

Users will select a directory in which they will place mods, which will then show up in the GUI. Clicking on a mod will bring up a window to export the mod, with built-in support for Ryujinx and Atmosphere (both USB and FTP transfer).
