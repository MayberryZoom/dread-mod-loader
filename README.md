# Dread Mod Loader
A desktop application for loading mods for Metroid Dread. Includes support for [open-dread-rando](https://github.com/randovania/open-dread-rando) JSON files, as well as writing fully custom mods using Python code. Any mod can provide custom assets which will be automatically included in the final exported mod. Mod devs can also provide a custom GUI on a per mod basis for configurable mod settings.

Users will select a directory in which they will place mods, which will then show up in the GUI. Clicking on a mod will bring up a window to export the mod, with built-in support for Ryujinx and Atmosphere (both USB and FTP transfer).

# IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE
Installed mods should be treated with extreme caution, as they run unchecked code. This program provides no guard rails and any mod should be treated like downloading an exe. This program's *only* goal is to provide mod devs with a simple GUI for their patcher code and a method of easy, centralized mod distribution.
