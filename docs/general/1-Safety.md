It's very important to remember than DML mods run completely unchecked code. This means they could contain malicious code. Here's a few safety practices for DML mods:

- Be cautious with mods that are not open source. While an open source mod could theoretically still be malicious, they're much less likely to be, as the code is public and the author can be held responsible more easily. If a mod is closed source, you should be extremely cautious with it.
- You should treat every downloaded mod as an exe. If you wouldn't trust it as an exe, you shouldn't trust it as a DML mod.
- Really, the core of this is: **do not install mods unless you completely trust the mod author**. It's better to be safe than sorry.
